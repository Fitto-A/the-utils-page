## The Utils Page

[Site](https://fitto-a.github.io/the-utils-page)

This is a page which contains different apps, each one with different functionalities. Some of them can be useful for development or design projects.

This sites are made with React and Reac Router Dom. With them I could practice the use of Styled Components, fetching Apis and React Hooks. And also some diferent libraries like Yup and Formik.

The projects are from different React courses like:
